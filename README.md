# cljyenc

A Clojure library to encode binary data into YEnc and decode text encoded in YEnc. The libraries name is pronouned (See-El-Jenk)

## Usage

The niche use of YEnc
is to encode binary data into strings that won't confuse text based protocols of network applications.This library takes bytes and encodes them into a string using YEnc. My own usage is to encode bytes into String and back, since the built in Java character encodings aren't able to consistently and accurately reproduce byte streams from input strings in my experience. YEnc was originally used as a replacement for UUEncode on USENET. MIME has superseeded text based protocols for a while. 

## Analysis

The following is a description of the YEnc algorithm. It is a very simple procedure. YEnc relies on using most of the ASCII character set. It's historical use was for encoding USNET messages. We provide the basic algorithm in pseudocode.

### Encoding

The following describes how each character is encoded. All characters are shifted by 42 modulo 256. This is to avoid escaping frequently encountered lengthy chains of NULL or 0 characters. If after shifting we end up with one of the 5 critical characters (NULL, 9, 10, 13, or the escape character "="), we escape it with an = and shift the ordinal of the character by an additional 64. Hence the name *Yenc* as in *Wh**Y** **Enc**ode?* 

```
FOR EACH byte IN byte-array:
    ADD 42 TO byte MOD 256, STORE IN x
    CASE x OF
        0, 9, 10, 13, 61: OUTPUT "=" and x + 64
        DEFAULT: OUTPUT x
```

### Decoding

The encoding is reversed. If we encounter an escape character "=", we subtract 106 (64 + 42) from the following character. Otherwise we subtract 42 from each character to recover the original values.

```
SET critical_flag FALSE
FOR EACH char in character-array:
    STORE ORDINAL VALUE OF char IN x
    CASE x OF
        case 61: 
            read next character as critical (set read-next-as-critical-flag to true), and continue
        DEFAULT:
            IF critical_flag THEN
                SET critical_flag FALSE
                output x - 64 - 42 MOD 256 (or - 106), and continue
            ELSE
                output x - 42 MOD 256, and continue
```

### Related Java Caveats

In Java `byte` is signed, so we must must promote and convert `byte`s to unsigned `int`s with the static method `Byte.toUnsignedInt()` to coerce the right numbers out of  the computations. To change the integer back we use the instance method of `Integer`, `.byteValue()` which returns the unsigned integer to a signed version.

### Known Flaws and Limitations

The algorithm is a first iteration, and could use some optimizations and improved input validation.
